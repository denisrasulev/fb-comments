On April 22, 2016 one of the popular Kazakhstan's bloggers - Ms [Asel Bayandarova]
(https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004350093268&fref=nf)
had publishd facebook post titled "Что можно делать казашкам." (What are kazakh
women allowed to do).

This post has had sparkled a fierce discussion in the comments between facebook
users of Kazkhstan, who had clearly separated into two large groups - with one
being supportive to the Original Poster, while other blaming OP up to the use of
obscene vocabulary.

Overall this post has more than 20,000 likes, 990 shares and about 8000 comments.

The purpose of the project is to research overall statistics of the comments, likes,
and make some time-series and sentiment analysis.
