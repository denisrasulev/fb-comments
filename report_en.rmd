## Introduction

On April 22, 2016 one of the notable (36,530 followers) Kazakhstani bloggers - [Asel Bayandarova](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004350093268&fref=nf)
has published facebook post titled ["Что можно делать казашкам"](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=621724294649235&id=100004350093268)
("What kazakh women are allowed to do"). The post was accompanied by a rather provocative photograph in green swimming trunks alone, (almost) without demonstrating intimate body parts.

The post has sparkled a fierce discussion between facebook users of Kazkhstan (and abroad), who divided into two groups with one being supportive to the Original Poster, while the other blaming OP up to the use of obscene vocabulary.

Overall this post got more than 20,000 likes, 990 shares and about 11,000 comments + replies, so the purpose of this project is exploratory and sentiment analysis of those comments.

## Getting data

The entire process of getting and cleaning data is neither optimal (even close) nor easily reproducible in its current state. The development of a method to obtain / clean such data in optimal way has become a separate project. If you are interested in this topic, please add / follow me using any social contacts provided at the end of the report.

In order to get text of all the comments and replies, I have used [special bookmarklet](http://com.hemiola.com/2015/08/29/expand-all/), which allowed to open all comments, See More, Replies, View more etc. links. 

You need to know that Facebook stops delivering comments hidden behind *View more comments* link after a certain point; you click it and nothing happens. This bookmarklet bumps into the same limitation. In order to overcome it I had to stop the bookmarklet, wait few hours (overnight or about 7 hours) and then continue. Eventually all comments and replies were opened.

After that all text from the page was copied and pasted to [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for further processing. One year later, in 2017, I have added some fresh comments that people were still making. File contains 34,890 lines and occupies 2,3 MB of disk space.

Here is the sample of the unprocessed text file containg all the information.

## Cleaning data

As we can see from the sample above, general structure of the text is as follows:

1. FirstName LastName + '\\n'
2. Body of a comment, always starts with FirstName LastName + text + '\\n'
     - may be empty or contain word 'photo' if only a picture was used as a comment
3. Special bod (Unicode '\U00B7') followed by either of two:
     - Number of likes + bod + Month Date with one or two digits + 'at' + time + '\\n'
     - Month Date with one or two digits + 'at' + time + '\\n'

Sublime Text 3 has very convenient search/replace tool:
![](images/st3sr.png)

Below you will find all the commands and regex search strings that were used step by step to find and replace / delete certain text constructions.

```
16 lines with unopened reply comment
^\d reply
delete them

dates without year, these are only present in fresh comments made in 2017
^(·\s\w+\s\d{1,2}) at
add year
\1, 2017 at

lines without any likes, they start with bod + space + capital letter (month name)
^·\s([A-Z]{1}) 
replace with
· 0 · \1
so that all similar constructions now look alike:
· 5 · April 22 at 5:24am

simplify previous string to ease further processing:
search for
^·\s(\d+)\s·\s(\w+)
replace with
· \1\n· \2
to split it into two strings and get
· 5
· April 22 at 5:24am

empty lines between first and last names
^(\w+)\s(\w+)\n\s
\1\s\2\n
delete them

stuck lines, about 150 entries, need to delete manually :)
[ap]m\n\w+\s\w+

smiles and other emoticons excluding letters, numbers, punctuation etc
[^a-zA-Z0-9а-яА-Яё:.,\-='"()·!?Ұүқôәіңғ\s]
copy them all and save to a different file for further counting / processing
```

Some other regex search strings that were used and may prove useful while processing this file:

```
lines containing "· 2 · April 22"
^(\s*.\s*[a-zA-Z0-9]*\s.*\s[a-zA-Z0-9]*\s*\d*\sat\s\d*:\d*(am|pm))

lines containing "· 2 ·"
^(\·\s*\d*\s.*)

lines containing "· Edited"
^(\s*\·\s*Edited)

lines with first last names only
^\w+\s+\w+\n

first and double last name, which is connected by "-"
^\w+\s+\w+-\w+\n

double, triple etc newlines
^\n{2,}

somebody's photo.
^[A-ZА-Я]\w{2,}\s*[A-ZА-Я]\w*'s photo.

first and last names in the beginning, including russian and kazakh (diacritic) letters
^[A-ZА-ЯҚƏ]\w{2,}(\s+|\.?)[A-ZА-ЯҚƏ]\w*\s+
```
Overall this part took most time and involved lots of manual work. File contains 55,145 lines and occupies 2,3 MB of disk space. Here is the sample of the file after all the cleaning was done:

## Pre-processing

For pre-processing of the cleaned file I wrote special parser function. Knowing the structure of the prepared file, we can go through it line by line saving required pieces of information to data frame.

```{r parser}
# Information parser for pre-processed file
# (c) 2017 Denis Rasulev
# All Rights Reserved

parse_comments <- function(comments) {
     # this function goes through pre-processed comments file row by row,
     # finds information by certain markers and saves it to data frame as
     # name, text of comment, number of likes and date posted
     # returns data.frame['name','cmnt','like','year',''month','day','hour']

     # load required libraries
     library(lubridate)  # Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier

     # save length of file with comments
     number_of_rows <- length(comments)

     # prepare empty data frame to store name, comment, likes and dates
     df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = number_of_rows))
     colnames(df) <- c('name','cmnt','like','date')

     for (i in 1:number_of_rows ) {

          # if row is empty...
          if ( comments[i] == "" ) {

               # then next row contains commenter's name
               df[i, 'name'] <- comments[i + 1]

               # third row after empty one contains text of a comment and
               # it always starts with the name of a commenter so we remove it
               comment_text <- sub(paste0(comments[i + 1],' '), '', comments[i + 2])

               # text of a comment may be on several lines so we need index
               # to read them all
               j <- 3

               # while next line doesn't start with middle dot '·' (unicode 00B7)
               while (substring(comments[i + j], 1, 1) != '\U00B7') {

                    # check if we have reached end of the file where we need to
                    # break the loop
                    if ( i + j > number_of_rows ) {
                         break
                    }

                    # if not end then add every line to comment
                    comment_text <- paste(comment_text, comments[i + j])
                    j <- j + 1
               }

               # save complete text of a comment
               df[i, 'cmnt'] <- comment_text

               # save number of likes for a comment, removing midle dot
               df[i, 'like'] <- sub('\U00B7 ', '', comments[i + j])

               # save date when a comment was posted, removing midle dot
               df[i, 'date'] <- sub('\U00B7 ', '', comments[i + j + 1])
          }
     }

     # remove empty rows, consisting only of NAs
     df <- na.omit(df)

     # convert number of likes from character to number
     df[,'like'] <- as.numeric(df[,'like'])

     # split date column for convenience of further analysis
     df[,'dt']    <- parse_date_time(df[,'date'], orders = "mdy IMp")
     df[,'year']  <- year(df[,'dt'])
     df[,'month'] <- month(df[,'dt'])
     df[,'day']   <- day(df[,'dt'])
     df[,'hour']  <- hour(df[,'dt'])

     # remove unused columns
     df[,c('date','dt')] <- NULL

     # return clean data frame
     return(df)
}

```

Parsing takes some time and returns tidy data frame.

## Setup and load data

```{r load_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Facebook Comments Exploration and Analysis
# (c) 2017 Denis Rasulev
# All Rights Reserved

# set working directory
setwd('/Volumes/data/projects/fb_sentiment/')

# load required libraries and functions
library(tm)         # Framework for text mining applications within R
library(NLP)        # Basic classes and methods for Natural Language Processing
library(ggplot2)    # Implementation of the grammar of graphics in R
library(wordcloud2) # Fast visualization tool for creating wordcloud
source("parser.r")
source("helper.r")

# if parsed file does not exist
if (!file.exists("data/comments.rds")) {

     # then load pre-processed comments file
     comments_file  <- readLines("data/comments_processed.txt",
                                 encoding = "UTF-8", skipNul = FALSE, warn = FALSE)

     # parse everything from it
     parsed <- parse_comments(comments_file)

     # and save it to disk
     saveRDS(parsed, file = "data/comments.rds")

     # clear memory
     rm(comments_file, parse_comments, parsed)
}

# if parsed file already exists, read it in
df_comments <- readRDS("data/comments.rds")
```

## Basic time analysis

```{r time, fig.align='center'}
# aggregate data by time frame
t1 <- table(df_comments$year)   # year
t2 <- table(df_comments$month)  # month
t3 <- table(df_comments$day)    # day
t4 <- table(df_comments$hour)   # hour

# distribution of comments by year
par(mar = c(3,5,3,1) + 0.1)
barplot(t1,
        col = "lightgreen",
        ylim = c(0,12000),
        las = 1)
title("Number of Comments by Year", adj = 0.5, line = 1)

# distribution of comments by month
barplot(t2,
        col = "lightgreen",
        ylim = c(0,12000),
        las = 1)
title("Number of Comments by Month", adj = 0.5, line = 1)

# distribution of comments by day
barplot(t3,
        col = "lightgreen",
        ylim = c(0,5000),
        las = 1)
title("Number of Comments by Day", adj = 0.5, line = 1)

# distribution of comments by hour
barplot(t4,
        col = "lightgreen",
        ylim = c(0,800),
        las = 1)
title("Number of Comments by Hour", adj = 0.5, line = 1)
```

## Exploratory Analysis 1 - Emoticons & Words
